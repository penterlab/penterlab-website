Livius Penter is a Physician Scientist and board-certified Internist at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin in Germany.
He received his MD from Charité in 2014 and successfully defended his medical thesis (Dr. med.) in 2015.
After work as Junior Clinician Scientist with Leo Hansmann at Charité from 2015 to 2019, he completed his
postdoctoral research training in Cathy Wu’s lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 2019 to 2023.
He has been heading a Max-Eder research group since 2023 with a focus on tumor-specific immune responses in the
context of blood malignancies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To gain a deep understanding of
leukemia and immune cell interactions, the Penter lab interrogates primary human samples using computational biology and single cell genomics approaches.
