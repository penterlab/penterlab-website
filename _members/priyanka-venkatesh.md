My primary interest lies in exploring heterogeneity at both individual and cellular levels through multi-omics approaches, with a particular focus on their implications for cancer diagnosis and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. The objective of my project is to identify definitive measurable residual disease (MRD) indicators at the single-cell level and to gain deeper insights into the evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
