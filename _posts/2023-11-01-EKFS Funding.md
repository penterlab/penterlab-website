We are super excited about the news that Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung has decided to 
fund our proposal to use long-read single cell sequencing technologies to identify
novel immunotherapeutic targets in AML/MDS. We'll soon look for a PhD student who will
work on this exciting project. Stay tuned!
