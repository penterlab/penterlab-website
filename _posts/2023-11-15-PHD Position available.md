We have two PhD positions available for projects that will focus on interactions 
between leukemia and immune cells. 

In the first project, we will utilize natural genetic barcodes to track leukemia
evolution before and after immunotherapeutic bottlenecks such as allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation. 

In the second project, we will long-read sequencing to better understand alternative 
splicing in AML and to use this approach for the identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets.

Looking forward to your application!
