A satisfying conclusion to a side-story that became a major project of Livius' postdoc with Cathy Wu.

We show co-evolution of mitochondrial and somatic nuclear DNA mutations using various approaches
including reanalysis of bulk RNA and WES-seq data, single cell DNA sequencing and ASAP-seq. 
Further, we use maternal mitochondrial DNA variants to track rare donor or recipient-derived
single cells following allogeneic stem cell transplantation to map out microchimeric states,
such as residual leukemia at incipient relapse or remaining donor-derived hematopoiesis at time
of frank hematologic recurrence.
