Priyanka Venkatesh has started her work funded by the John Hansen Research grant from DKMS to explore
the phenotypes of measurable residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. 
With her background in dry and wet lab, she is bringing in all the skills needed for this challenging project. 

Good luck Priyanka!
