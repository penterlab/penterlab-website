Tim Berneiser has started his work as PhD student funded through [TARGET-MPN](https://for-5659.com/).
He has a great background in wet and dry lab approaches, including internships in single cell genomics
at the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology (MDC-BIMSB).
Tim will interrogate the genetics and transcriptomics of MPN in a longitudinal fashion and collaborate
closely with Prof. Lars Bullinger's group. 

Welcome Tim!
