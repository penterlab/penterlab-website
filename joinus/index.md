## Our mission

We are dedicated to the study of immune cell responses against cancer with a particular focus on blood malignancies
and resistance mechanisms that permit malignant cell populations to evade immunity. Our mission is to identify 
strategies that could improve current immunotherapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
and to aid the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.
Our approach puts an emphasis on the mining of immunogenomic datasets such as large-scale single cell analyses.
