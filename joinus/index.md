## Our mission

We are dedicated to the study of immune cell responses against cancer with a particular focus on blood malignancies
and resistance mechanisms that permit malignant cell populations to evade immunity. Our mission is to identify 
strategies that could improve current immunotherapies such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
and to aid the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.
Our approach puts an emphasis on creative and deep mining of immunogenomic datasets including large-scale single cell analyses. 

## Joining the team

We are looking for wet-lab and dry-lab oriented researchers at all levels (technician, master or MD thesis, PhD student, postdoc).

We are committed to the personal growth and academic career advancement of each member who joins our lab. 

Please write to [Livius Penter](mailto:livius.penter@charite.de) why you want to join the lab together with your CV.
