To understand co-evolution of leukemic and immune cell populations, we are interested in (i) lineage-tracing techniques 
that leverage natural genetic barcodes to map out clonal evolution following (immuno)-therapeutic bottlenecks such as 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and (ii) multi-omics approaches to define therapeutically relevant T cell populations.

## Lineage-tracing using natural genetic barcodes

The availability of approaches to resolve combined genetic and phenotypic information at single cell resolution opens up 
opportunities to better understand how immune resistance mechanisms develop that provide selective advantage 
and fuel clonal evolution. 
We are also excited about the possibility to integrate multiple genetic barcodes (mitochondrial and somatic nuclear DNA mutations,
copy number changes, expressed germline single nucleotide polymorphisms) to track rare malignant cells.
