# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-brain" %}Research

Our research focuses the dissection of mechanisms that underlie response and resistance to 
immunotherapies and on the longitudinal tracking of tumor cell evolution using single-cell
lineage-tracing approaches based on interrogation of natural barcodes like somatic nuclear 
or mitochondrial DNA mutations.
